
The folder main_code contains Models an empty folder to be used for saving models with joblib saving_models.ipynb or .py file to save models 
and final_prediction to predict rainfall using saving_models
rf_predictions.py and saving_files.py are just extra python files to run code directly using python editor

## Instructions:
1. First run saving_models.py file it will fit save all models(34 for each station) using joblib 
which will be saved in folder named Models
2. Then after saving models, predictions can be made using final_prediction.ipynb

Extra notebooks for data preprocessing are provided in other folder

The folder other notebooks contains notebook named 
- Auto_regression.ipynb explaining model chosen and parameters 
- final_doc.csv is provided in folder named main_code but can be created using Data_imputation.ipynb
- Models is empty folder to be used for saving models with joblib

Extra python packages used:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- statsmodel
- joblib
